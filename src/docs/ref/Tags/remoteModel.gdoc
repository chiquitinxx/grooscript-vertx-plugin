h1. remoteModel

Use your domain classes in your browser, and change data in the server.

{code}
<grooscript:remoteModel domainClass="myPackage.Book"/>
{code}

@domainClass@ can be short name of the class or full name with package.

All methods are a promise, and you need to define closures to success or failures.

Also have to define permission to your domain classes in Config.groovy

*Still experimental, and only works with grails 2.3.x *
